# Asteroid_mystery
In this project I have used Asteroid data files that I have also provided in the repository,and performed Data Analysis on the Asteroid Dataset. It also includes the
3D data distribution of data columns [a,e,i] where a stands for semi-major axis(AU), e for eccentricity and i for inclination.
I have also performed clustering on the data but due to less computational power I was not able to get the clustered plot in the python notebook, so I've provided the png file for that.
